Generate a Privacy Policy with LLM:

```
Act as a legal expert. Write me a comprehensive and GDPR-compliant privacy policy for my website.
My website name is ___
My business name is ___
I sell ___
My email is ___
Today's date is ___
Make sure it covers data collection, storage, usage, sharing, and security measures, while also addressing users' rights and how they can exercise them. Make sure to include any necessary legal language and provisions to maintain transparency and protect user privacy effectively.
```

Convert it to markdown if the LLM doesn't generate it in markdown.

Don't forget to review and revise the content.

Make sure the format is also consistent (e.g. all page headers are using h1).
