# Terms and Conditions for Your Company

Generate Terms & Conditions with LLM:

```
Act as a legal expert. Write me a comprehensive terms and conditions page for my website.
My website name is ___
My business name is ___
I sell ___
My email is ___
Today's date is ___
```

Convert it to markdown if the LLM doesn't generate it in markdown.

Don't forget to review and revise the content.

Make sure the format is also consistent (e.g. all page headers are using h1).

Also add these to the Governing Law section

These Terms shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of Indonesia, without regard to conflict of law principles.
Any disputes arising out of or in connection with these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Indonesia.
In any such proceedings, InitWFIndo shall be represented solely by its current owning limited liability company, and not by its founders in their individual capacities.
