# Returns & Refunds Policy

Generate a Returns & Refunds Policy with LLM:

```
Act as a legal expert. Please write a comprehensive returns and refunds policy for my website that clearly explains the process, conditions, and timeframes for product returns and refunds. Include information on how customers can initiate a return, any fees or costs involved, any specific product requirements, and contact information for customer support. Make the policy easy to understand, user-friendly, and fair for both the customers and the business.

Make sure all "returns" is before "refunds" in any "returns and refunds" phrase (don't switch them around)

My website name is ___
My business name is ___
I sell ___
My email is ___
Today's date is ___
```

Convert it to markdown if the LLM doesn't generate it in markdown.

Don't forget to review and revise the content.

Make sure the format is also consistent (e.g. all page headers are using h1).
